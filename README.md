# Cisco PSIRT openVuln API

## Overview
The [Cisco PSIRT openVuln API](https://developer.cisco.com/psirt/) is a RESTful API that allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. It supports industrywide security standards such as:
* OASIS Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) 
* Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) identifiers
* Common Weakness Enumerator (CWE)
* Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

**NOTE**: [CSAF](https://csaf.io) is a specification for structured machine-readable vulnerability-related advisories and further refine those standards over time.
